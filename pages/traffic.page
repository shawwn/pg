This graph shows traffic from Jan 2001 to Aug 2005.
The big spikes mostly represent slashdottage.

The biggest spike is <a href="hs.html">What You'll
Wish You'd Known</a>.
The most popular essays over the
long term are <a href="gh.html">Great Hackers</a> and 
<a href="start.html">How to Start a Startup</a>.

This graph was generated by Yahoo Store.  The software 
that generates them was
written by <a href="http://trevorblackwell.com">Trevor Blackwell</a>,
who later became famous as the mad inventor who built his 
<a href="http://www.tlb.org/scooter.html">own
Segway</a>.  I wish now we'd added a log scale option.
