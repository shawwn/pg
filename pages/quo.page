anything more than an unfortunate legacy from theology.\"

 "\"If we chose always to be wise we should rarely need to be virtuous. But inclinations which we could easily overcome irresistibly attract us. We give in to slight temptations and minimize the danger.

  of England in the fifteenth century. This was a
  masterpiece of egregious perversity, depicting the
  later Middle Ages as a culminating period of ruinous
  taxation, iniquitous labour laws, demoralizing
  pestilences, and lavish dissipation of national
  resources upon violent and embittered domestic feuds
  and futile and indecisive foreign wars. The credulity

successful in the exercise of what they regarded as social responsibility.
