(title: "Bel")
Oct 2019

Bel is a spec for a new dialect of Lisp, written in itself. This should sound familiar to people who know about Lisp's origins, because it's <a href="rootsoflisp.html"><font color="#000099">the way Lisp began</font></a>.

It consists of two text files meant to be read in parallel: a <a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/bellanguage.txt?t=1688221954&"><font color="#000099">guide to the Bel language</font></a>, and the <a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/bel.bel?t=1688221954&"><font color="#000099">Bel source</font></a>.

For those who just want to see some code examples, there's a <a href="https://sep.turbifycdn.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/belexamples.txt?t=1688221954&"><font color="#000099">file of those</font></a>. But of course the Bel source is also a code example, since it's written in itself.

Considering the rate at which I was discovering bugs before publishing Bel, there are bound to be more remaining. So this first version is version C, after Cunningham's Law.
