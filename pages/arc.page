Arc is a new dialect of Lisp we're working on.   You can 
find an early release and ask questions at 
<a href="http://arclanguage.org">arclanguage.org</a>.
The Arc community is very newbie-friendly,
because all the users are newbies to some extent.

To get an idea of where we eventually hope to take Arc,
see <a href ="popular.html">Being Popular</a>
and <a href="hundred.html">The Hundred-Year Language</a>.
<!-- We do now have a reasonably efficient Arc implementation,
written by Robert Morris and me on top of MzScheme.
The next step is to beat it into shape on some real projects.
The most interesting is <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker
News</a>, which is written entirely in Arc, including the http
server.  Among other things this allowed us to add a read-eval-print
loop (which I obviously can't link to) that we can use to modify
the server as it's running, without restarting it.

When we release something, we'll set up a server where you'll be able to 
get an Arc toplevel through Web forms.
Anyone who wants to try Arc will be able to see the latest version
without having to download or install anything.
If you'd like to try Arc, send an email to <a href="mailto:tryarc@@paulgraham.com">tryarc@@paulgraham.com</a>
and we'll notify you when there is something online to experiment with.

When will that be?  We have no idea.  We reserve the right to take a
very long time.  It's been almost 50 years since
McCarthy first <a href="rootsoflisp.html">described</a> Lisp.  
Another 2 or 3 aren't going to kill
anyone. So please don't send us mail asking what
Arc's status is or when it will be done.
(When it's done, we'll tell you.)
