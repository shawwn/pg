<xfont color=#cccccc>Before emailing...
<ul>
<li> Is yours a <a href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Question</a>?

<li> Unfortunately I now get so much mail that I can't promise
to respond to every one.  I know this seems obnoxious, 
but I notice I have mails in my inbox that are two years
old.  I'm probably
never going to respond to them, and I may as well admit it.

<li> I respond faster to emails that 
are short.  Two-liners I often reply to immediately.  Long emails
I leave in my inbox to deal with later, and never do.
</ul>
My email address is my first and last initial at Y Combinator.
