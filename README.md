# pg.arc
[pg.arc](https://github.com/shawwn/pg/blob/main/pg.arc) is a site generator
for [paulgraham.com](http://paulgraham.com)-style websites.
Since paulgraham.com was made with [Viaweb](https://paulgraham.com/vw.html),
I ended up reimplementing most of what made Viaweb special. And since
it's written in Arc, it ended up being just a [few hundred lines](https://github.com/shawwn/pg/blob/main/pg.arc).

Live site: [https://shawwn.github.io/pg/](https://shawwn.github.io/pg/)

By default, this repository generates a facsimile of paulgraham.com,
which you can see above. But it's easy to make your own;
the reason I wrote pg.arc was to make mine:
[https://shawwn.github.io](https://shawwn.github.io)

## setup
TODO, since my daughter Kess woke up. Stay tuned.
